> I have started this course on `11`<sup>th</sup> July, `2022`. I am also doing #100 Days of Code, on [Day 36](https://github.com/Param302/100DaysOfCode-Python/tree/main/Day-36) I have started.
> Check my 100 Days of Code Repository [here](https://github.com/Param302/100DaysOfCode-Python)

In every course, I have my notes, my codes, and quizzes (you can solve and submit too!). And I have tried my best to make good notes, so that anytime I want to revise, I can come here and revise and you too!

Hope you'll like ⭐ my notes too 😊.
